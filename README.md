# StockDataTool
I'm just writing a simple tool for stock market analysis here.
The goal is to develop the following functionality:
* retrieve historical prices data for selected stocks
* calculate AAR, Risk-return raio
* retrieve multiplicators, both current values and historical data
* calculate the rule-based go - no-go decision for each stock

Disclaimer: I am not a professional developer. This is for fun and personal use only. However, feel free to contribute and comment =)
