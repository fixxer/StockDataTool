# StockDataTool
I'm just writing a simple tool for stock market analysis here.

The goal is to develop the following functionality:
* download the list of traded stocks
* retrieve historical prices data for selected stocks
* calculate AAR, Risk-return raio
* enrich stocks with P/E and P/B data
* calculate the rule-based go - no-go decision for each stock
 
Disclaimer: I am not a professional developer. This is for fun and personal use only. However, feel free to contribute and comment =)
